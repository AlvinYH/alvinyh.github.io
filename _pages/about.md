I am a first-year graduate student in [Computer Science at Center on Frontiers of Computing Studies](http://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University. I am a member of the [Computer Vision and Digital Art Lab](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/research/researchlabs/237028.htm), advised by [Prof. Yizhou Wang](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/people/faculty/yizhouwang/index.htm). I received my Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence from Peking University in 2023.

My research area is computer vision. Recently, my work focuses perceiving, reconstructing, and understanding human behaviors (human pose estimation, 3D human avatar reconstruction, etc.).
