I am a senior undergraduate majoring in Artificial Intelligence at Yuanpei College in [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/). I am also a member of [Tong Class](https://www.ai.pku.edu.cn/info/1064/1888.htm), which is an elite undergraduate program of General Artificial Intelligence led by [Prof. Songchun Zhu](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~sczhu/).

I am fortunate to work as a research assistant in [the Computer Vision and Digital Art Lab](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/research/researchlabs/237028.htm), advised by [Prof. Yizhou Wang](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/people/faculty/yizhouwang/index.htm). My research area is computer vision. Recently, my work focuses perceiving, reconstructing, and understanding human behaviors (human pose estimation, 3D human avatar reconstruction, etc.).
